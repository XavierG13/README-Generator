## Description:

This application will allow a user to add burgers, eat burgers, and delete burgers.

## Installation Process:

npm install - to create package.json npm i express - to set up web application npm i mysql - to utilize mysql database npm i method-override - to allow use of verbs such as PUT or DELETE in places where client does not support npm i body-parser - parse incoming request bodies before your handlers, under req.body property npm i express-handlebars - for use of handlebars modules

## Usage:

This project is used to demonstrate the MVC model. User's will be able tp utilize PUT and POST requests as well as DELETE requests following this model. The Mysql DB is broken down into three main areas under burgers.js in models folder, burgers_controller.js and orm.js, which will then be used to input data into our views folder which holds our handlebars. User's will be able to create a burger of their choosing, once created they will then be able to eat the burger and then remove it from the DB. This is all done through the routes set up in our ajax calls in public folder under burgers.js.
